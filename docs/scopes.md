## Scope Definitions

NoBrainer allows named scopes to be defined on Models.
Scopes are defined by declaring a class method on a model. Such method must
return a criterion. Example:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Model
  def self.active
    where(:active => true)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

You can also use the `scope` method which defines a class method with
whatever you pass as a block. Example:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Model
  scope(:active) { where(:active => true }
end
{% endhighlight %}

When a class method is found in a chain of criteria, the method is executed and
the returned criterion is merged with the chain. Example with the previously
declared scope:

{% highlight ruby %}
Model.where(:email => /@gmail/).active.count
# Equivalent to
Model.where(:email => /@gmail/).where(:active => true }.count
{% endhighlight %}

Scopes can accept arguments. Example:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Model
  def self.created_before(time)
    where(:created_at.lt => time)
  end
end

Model.created_before(1.week.ago).count
{% endhighlight %}

## Default Scopes

Default scopes are scopes that are merged in criteria when constructing a query.
Adding `unscoped` in the criteria will disable the use of the default scope.
Adding `scoped` will add it back. Example:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Model
  default_scope { where(:active => true) }
end

Model.count # returns only active models
Model.unscoped.count # returns all models
Model.unscoped.scoped.count # returns active models
{% endhighlight %}

Note that many default scopes can be declared. All of them are applied, in the
order of declaration. This can come in handy when using polymorphic models with
different default scopes declared in parents and subclasses. Example:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Parent
  default_scope { order_by(:created_at) }
  default_scope { where(:active => true) }
end

class Child < Parent
  default_scope { where(:created_by => :admin) }
end
{% endhighlight %}

Default scopes are applied at the beginning of the chain when building a query.
The following example illustrates this fact:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Model
  default_scope { order_by(:created_at) }
end

Model.each { } # ordered by created_at
Model.unscoped.order_by(:id).scoped.each { } # ordered by ids, even though scoped is called after
{% endhighlight %}

The `unscoped` keyword has no effect on `has_many` associations have a custom `:scope` defined.

Unlike the ActiveRecord behavior, `where()` filters in default scopes are not overridable.
For example, consider a Model with a default scope of `where(:active => true)`.
With ActiveRecord, `Model.where(:active => false)` will yield all inactive
models, while NoBrainer will return nothing. This is because NoBrainer
evaluates  
`Model.where(:active => true).where(:active => false)`, which evaluates to  
`Model.where(:and => [:active => true, :active => false])`.

## Default Scopes are sometimes ignored

NoBrainer will not use the default scopes in the following cases:

1. When using a `dependent` option on an association, such as  
   `has_many :stuff, :dependent => :destroy`, the Stuff model is used unscoped.
   For example, upon destroy, NoBrainer will perform a `Stuff.unscoped.destroy_all`.
2. When using `validates_uniqueness_of :some_field`, NoBrainer will not use the
   default scope to find any duplicates of `some_field`.
4. When using `belongs_to` associations.
